    "name": "So the creator of Cocaine Diablo X is a hacker, so I'll say something quickly. I'm still verifying CDX no matter what, it's my passion project in this game rn, but I haven't had time to play it recently because of school and IRL stuff. I'll try my best to verify it before the end of the year, but I'll play it as much as I can for now. Love y'all",
